The code is in Python Language

Though the code is self-explanatory but uses the following things:
1) API: https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?q=London,us&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22 (Open Weather API)
2) It receives a JSON object which is then parsed and converted into a python dictionary.
